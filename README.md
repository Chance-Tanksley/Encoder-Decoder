# Encoder-Decoder
Encoder Docoder is another major project from my class in MCA. We were tasked to develop two programs; one that would encode a message into a ppm file and the other that would display the message from the encoded ppm file.
The encoder program has the user open a ppm image file to encode a message into. The program will then convert the ppm file into a bitmap and list of colors. The program will then prep the image by slightly converting the blue in each pixel if the blue's value is a converted int is equal to the char of a captial letter or space. Then the program goes through the provided message and changes the blue in the top left corner pixels into the converted int of that char. The new encoded image is then displayed on the program and the user can save the image which will then convert it back into a ppm file.
The decoder program has the user open the encoded ppm file from the previous encoder program and converts it to a bitmap and list of colors. The program will then be able to find the hidden message in the blue of each pixel that contain the message and displays it in a text box.
